description: This file contains thinking approach instructions. It should be applied to all files in the project.

Before starting work, explain to yourself what is the scope of request and work, what are the dependencies and main subject. If unsure - deduce from whole project context and best coding practices. Get to know the files and code in scope.

Always question your assumptions and logic from previous messages. If you are not sure about something, ask for clarification, cross-check with other files, strive for understanding the whole context.

After that critically validate your explanations, assumptions and rationales. Adjust your logic.
After that - plan your work. Consider overall architecture and reuse existing code in your plan.
After that rebase your branch with origin/master and resolving conflicts. Only now you can edit any code. Accommodate incoming code to your changes.
After that work on the task as usual.

In your thinking apply Occam's Razor - prefer the simplest solution that works.
Always go for smallest possible change that achieves the goal.
Opt for incremental changes that can be tested and deployed easily.
Opt for reusability. Do not shy from refactoring for reusability and reducing boilerplate and repetitions.
