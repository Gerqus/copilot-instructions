description: This file contains coding standards, development guidelines, set of good practices and such. It should be applied to all code files in the project.

**Carefully follow ALL of the rules listed below**:
- Modularize the code as blackboxes (private logic and public interfaces)
- Prefer using installed packages over writing own code
- When making changes always reuse existing functions and methods if possible.
- Reduce boilerplate.
- ALWAYS write code using principles of SOLID, ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability), DRY, KISS and YAGNI
- Functions should not cause side effects if possible.
- Keep the code concise and conscious.
- Avoid conditional logic (`if`, `&&`, `||`, `? :` etc.) and flags. Instead handle empty and falsy values gracefully.
- Make the code and architecture modular and highly maintainable.
- Methods should prefer getting data through `this` keyword instead of parameters when possible.
- Insert logic into existing files with similar logic.
- Use available utility functions.
- Refactor and reuse existing code instead of writing new code.
- Clean the code after you are done with changes. Remove dead code, console logs, comments, unused variables and imports.
- Keep the project tidy and organized.
- When refactoring, keep logically connected areas together.
- Prefer shorter files.
- Precisely follow instructions - do not add anything not mentioned and not necessary to complete the task successfully.
- If you write a function or method - check if such functionality does not exist already. Reuse it. If it's scattered in many instances across the project - refactor to use one method in place of all that occurrences for maintainability.
- BackEnd is THE SOLE authority of application state. It decides whether user is logged in, who they are, what they can do and what data they can access.
- NEVER trust FrontEnd with anything - inputs, reports, identity, host. Consider it hostile environment.
- On BackEnd always sanitize and validate all inputs coming *from FrontEnd*.
- For each functionality maintain only one source of truth. If something is defined in one place - do not redefine it somewhere else, but reuse the original definition and derive from it.
- Centralize repetitive logic into reusable functions and methods
- Centralize repetitive functionalities into reusable services
- Centralize repetitive constants into reusable constant files
- Centralize repetitive types into reusable type definition files and interfaces
- Centralize general purpose functions into reusable utility files
- Try and reuse existing logic and functionalities and derive from them and build off of them as much as possible
- No fallbacks. Create one, robust solution that will work.
