# Project coding standards for SCSS
- prefer using SCSS over plain CSS
- use variables for colors, fonts, sizes, and other reusable values
- use nesting to organize styles and improve readability
- always `@use semantic-tokens.scss` at the top of the file and reuse the defined semantic tokens
- define and use mixins for reusable styles and patterns
- define and use functions for calculations and transformations
