# Project coding standards for TypeScript
## TypeScript Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all new code in *.ts files
- Follow functional programming principles where possible
- Use interfaces for data structures and type definitions
- Prefer immutable data (const, readonly)
- Use optional chaining (?.) and nullish coalescing (??) operators
- Use latest features from TypeScript language
- Use latest features from ESNext language
- Use async/await for asynchronous code
- Use type guards and type assertions where necessary
- Use union and intersection types for complex data structures
- Use generics for reusable components and functions
- Use enums for fixed sets of values
- Use tuples for fixed-length arrays with known types
- Use type aliases for complex types
- Use keyof and typeof operators for dynamic types
- Use mapped types for transforming types
- Use conditional types for type relationships
- Use utility types (Partial, Required, Readonly, Record, Pick, Omit, Exclude, Extract, NonNullable, Parameters, ConstructorParameters, ReturnType, InstanceType) where sensible
- Use declaration merging for extending existing types
- Use ambient declarations for external libraries
- Use JSDoc comments for documenting types and functions
- Use discriminated unions for type-safe polymorphism
