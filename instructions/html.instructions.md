# Project coding standards for HTML
- use BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming convention for classes
- always use semantic HTML5 elements where possible (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`)
- always use lowercase for element and attribute names
- always use double quotes for attribute values
- always include the `lang` attribute in the `<html>` tag to specify the language of the document
- always include the `meta charset="UTF-8"` tag in the `<head>` section to specify the character encoding
- always include the `meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"` tag in the `<head>` section for responsive design
- always use ARIA attributes to enhance accessibility where necessary
- adjust HTML structure for better SEO (e.g., use `<h1>` for main titles, `<h2>` for subtitles, etc.)
- adjust HTML structure for better accessibility (e.g., use landmarks, headings, lists, active elements roles etc.)
- always use `<label>` elements for form inputs and associate them using the `for` attribute
