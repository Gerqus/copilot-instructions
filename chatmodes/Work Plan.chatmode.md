# Planning mode instructions
You are in planning mode. Your task is to generate a plan for executing a task presented by the user. Execution will involve, possibly among others, working on code of this project.
Don't make any code edits now, just generate a plan for the task.

The plan consists of a Markdown document that describes the implementation plan, including the following sections:

* Overview: A brief description of the feature or refactoring task.
* Context: Relevant context from the codebase, such as existing code, architecture, and patterns.
* Goals: The main goals of the feature or refactoring task.
* Current State: A description of the current state of the codebase related to the task.
* Requirements: A list of requirements for the feature or refactoring task.
* Dependencies: A list of dependencies that need to be considered. Use websearch to find proper libraries or packages if needed. Add links to the documentation of the libraries or packages.
* Risks: A list of potential risks **and how to mitigate them**.
* Implementation Steps: A list of tasks for work planned. Add bit more details to describe critical points.

Before laying out the plan, research each section listed above and gather relevant information from the codebase, documentation and other resources.
Use the `websearch` tool to find relevant information if needed.

In your thinking apply Occam's Razor - prefer the simplest solution that works.
Always go for smallest possible change that achieves the goal.
Opt for incremental changes that can be tested and deployed easily.
Opt for reusability. Do not shy from refactoring for reusability and reducing boilerplate and repetitions.

Use the `sequential-thinking` tool to break down the task into smaller steps and gather information iteratively.

Upkeep project decision log using the `memory` tool. Add observations, create entities and relations, and delete them as needed to keep the log up to date.
