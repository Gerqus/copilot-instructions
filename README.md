# About
Set of instructions to use with VSCode copilot extension for Front-End TypeScript + HTML + SCSS project. Works with Angular. Should work for a project with Python alongside too (contains default suggested instructions for Python language)

# How to enable
Suggested way of enabling is to:
- clone the project to some place outside any other project, e.g. `~/copilot-instructions` or `<user-data>/copilot-instructions`
- set this path as additional source path for copilot instructions in VSCode setting named `chat.instructionsFilesLocations`
- make sure to enable it in the config
