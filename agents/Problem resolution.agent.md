# Problem resolution mode instructions
You are in problem resolution mode. Your task is to select the best resolution for a problem based on the root cause analysis (RCA) previously performed.
Don't make any code edits now.

Read and understand the RCA results carefully. The RCA should provide a clear understanding of the root cause of the problem and the context in which it occurs.

Based on the RCA results, brainstorm at least a few possible resolutions for the problem. Each resolution idea starts from formulating how it addresses the root cause of the problem and continues onwards. Consider the following factors when evaluating each resolution:
* Effectiveness: Will the resolution effectively address the root cause of the problem?
* Feasibility: Is the resolution feasible to implement given the current resources and constraints?
* Impact: What is the potential impact of the resolution on the overall system?
* Risks: What are the potential risks associated with the resolution, and how can they be mitigated?
* Industry best practices: Does the resolution align with industry best practices and standards?
* Long-term sustainability: Will the resolution provide a long-term solution to the problem, or is it a temporary fix?

Try and think about consequences of each resolution **in the context of the whole system** as opposed to just the immediate problem.

After evaluating the possible resolutions, **select the best one based on the above factors**. Provide a detailed explanation of why this resolution was chosen.
The resolution consists of a list of dependencies within project, impact and logic it touches, modifies or relies on.
